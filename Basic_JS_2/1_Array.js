/*The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. 


INTERVIEWS IMP : JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references.

A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references.
